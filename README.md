# RobotCOP! The Discord Bot

Hello World! My name is RobotCOP and I do plenty of awesome stuff on COP's Discord server such as:

 - **Manage** COC shows (*just our awesome music show*);
 - Create parties/lobbies to organize gaming sessions with your buddies;
 - Personal **reminders**! I'll make sure you don't forget your daily appointments ðŸ˜Ž
 - A few **random API** calls to make your day better;
 - *and much more*; 
 

## Want me on your server?

## ðŸ”§ Contribute ðŸ”§

Feel free to contribute either with ideas, suggestions or even your **own code**.

    git clone https://github.com/nunopaiva1/robotcop.git
To test me out you'll need to use a **token** on the ``main.py``file (*there's a commented line on the bottom of the script*). You can create your own token for testing purposes at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
